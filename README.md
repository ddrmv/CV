## About Me

An avid learner and hard-working junior software engineer with experience in Python, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++. Makers bootcamp graduate, with a degree in Computing, and a passion for high-quality code. Led by desire to learn and solve problems, aiming to write robust, maintainable, testable, high-quality software.

## Skills

#### Problem solver

- Implemented a once-an-hour server-wide refresh rate limit for an API call that had eluded multiple team members.
- Searched for and quickly provided the team with a resource/solution for resolving merge conflicts the first time the team had issues and needed to learn about github collaboration.
- Helped team members set up / troubleshoot unfamiliar development environments on AWS, WSL. Resolved dependencies and conflicts setting up a team project with new technologies.

#### Good communicator

- Ability to work in pairs and teams with different styles. More than once being able to step back and figure out a difficulty or mismatch in communication styles, to improve quality of communication and pair productivity.
- Praised multiple times by team members for initiating feedback, consistently putting effort into providing constructive positive and to-improve feedback for both team processes and technical implementation.
- Eager to receive feedback and continually improve, often incorporating feedback from team members.

#### Well organised and eager to take on responsibility

- Looking to take the initiative and own the responsibility for integral parts of Makers team projects, like hosting projects on Heroku; project frameworks, environment and tools setup; design/implementation/updating of a news application front-end.
- Keen on organising, updating and encouraging the use of project management tools including Trello, EasyRetro, team roles Rota; encouraging continual improvement of processes through feedback in retros and during pairing.
- Always willing to get the ball rolling by providing ideas to build on and encouraging input from all team members, for example guiding the discussion of positives and negatives of using a new language (TypeScript) towards achieving the team goals of learning and delivering a product.
- Willingness to raise the team's attention towards things that could be improved, for example pointing out the use of name instead of username in a social media app to match project specifications, discussing the downsides of an extra click in a one-page news headline app.

#### Good learner, attention to detail

- Greatly improved coding process within the span of two coding reviews. Moved from spending considerable time debugging somewhat complicated code, to test-driven algorithm development, keeping code simple, clean, with no debugging necessary.
- Read up on Bootstrap and after a day was able to quickly implement a range of features like cards, scrollspy, progress bars, navbar, as well as general styling and page layout for a team project.
- Picked up multiple technologies on the go while working on team projects: Handlebars, EJS, TypeScript typing, Cypress, MongoDB.
- Searching out conventions and better approaches for code quality and readability, for example well organised descriptions, contexts and test strings for test suites.

#### Good eye for design

- Styled a Makers team project, designing a theme for the site and implementing a big part of the front-end with EJS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS.
- Created visually impactful presentations within very strict time frames.
- Good understanding of visual focus, colour, contrast, spacing, form, applied in visual media (web design, game UI modding, presentations decks, 2D and 3D art).

## Experience

**Further training** (Jul-2022 - present)

- Built a Django-based website, "IENPCs", integrating features of a wiki, image gallery, game party manager

**Makers Academy / learning** (Jul-2022 - Nov-2022)

- Developed the ability to quickly learn and use unfamiliar frameworks and technologies through self-led learning (independently learned TypeScript, Bootstrap, EJS, Cypress, Handlebars)
- Developed a strong TDD process of writing code to optimise code simplicity and minimise debugging time (using RSpec, SimpleCov, Jest, Cypress)
- Emphasis on code quality through code reviews to solidify OOP, TDD, separation of concerns, good naming (in the Ruby and JavaScript languages)
- Iteratively improve processes of application design and collaborative development through multiple team projects (practising Agile, XP, Scrum, using Trello, Github, Live Share, Zoom)
- Daily pair programming to practise team work, communication and collaboration skills
