Creative and driven Junior Full-Stack Software Engineer with experience in Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Typescript (and some C++, Lua). Recent Makers graduate, with a degree in Computing, and a passion for writing high-quality, optimised code. With aptitude for maths and logic, lead by curiosity and desire to learn, I'm looking for a company where I would be able work on challenging problems and write meaningful and beautiful software.

## Skills

#### Problem solver

- Implemented a once-an-hour server-wide refresh rate limit for an api call that had eluded multiple team members.
- Searched for and quickly provided the team with a resource/solution for resolving merge conflicts the first time the team had issues and needed to learn about github collaboration.
- Helped team members set up / troubleshoot unfamiliar development environments on AWS, WSL. Resolved multiple dependencies and conflicts, setting up a team project base with various new technologies within a single day (Typescript, EJS, Jest).

#### Good communicator

- Ability to work in pairs and teams with different styles. More than once being able to step back and figure out a difficulty or mismatch in communication styles, to improve quality of communication and pair productivity.
- Praised multiple times by team members for initiating feedback, consistently putting effort into providing constructive positive and to-improve feedback for both team processes and technical implementation.
- Eager to receive feedback and continually improve, often incorporated feedback from team members (increased cues to more clearly convey agreement/disagreement, dynamic adjustment of exploration of ideas / focused work ratio).

#### Well organised and eager to take on responsibility

- Looking to take the initiative and own the responsibility for integral parts of Makers team projects, like hosting projects on Heroku; project frameworks, environment and tools setup; design/implementation/updating of a news application front-end.
- Keen on organising, updating and encouraging the use of project management tools including Trello, EasyRetro, team roles Rota; encouraging continual improvement of processes through feedback in retros and during pairing.
- Always willing to get the ball rolling by providing initial ideas to build on and encouraging input from all team members, for example guiding the discussion of positives and negatives of using a new language (TypeScript) towards achieving the team goals of learning and delivering a product.
- Insistence on correct solutions when the team considers going into a different direction, for example insisting on using name instead of username in a social media app to match project specifications, insistence for no extra click-through to avoid decrease in UX for a one-page news headline app.

#### Good learner, attention to detail

- Greatly improved coding process within the span of two coding reviews. Moved from spending considerable time debugging somewhat complicated code, to test-driven algorithm development, keeping code simple, clean, with no debugging necessary.
- Read up on Bootstrap and after a day was able to implement quickly a range of features like cards, scrollspy, progress bars, navbar, as well as general styling and page layout for a team project.
- Picked up multiple technologies on the go while working on team projects: Handlebars, EJS, TypeScript typing, Cypress, MongoDB.
- Searching out conventions and better approaches for code quality and readability, for example well organised descriptions, contexts and test strings for test suites.

#### Good eye for design

- Styled a Makers team project, designing a theme for the site and implementing a big part of the front-end with EJS, MDBootstrap, chart.js, HTML, CSS.
- Good understanding of visual focus, colour, contrast, spacing, form, applied in various visual media (web design, game UI modding, presentations decks, 2d and 3d art).
- Created visually impactful presentations within very strict time frames.

## Education

#### [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (Jul-2022 - Nov-2022)

- Developed a strong TDD process of writing code to opimise code simplicity and minimise debugging time (RSpec, Jest, Cypress).
- Emphasis on code quality through code reviews to solidify OOP, TDD, separation of concerns, good naming (Ruby, JavaScript).
- Frequently used paring in order to problem solve efficiently and exchange knowledge, requiring teamwork and communication.
- Developed concrete processes of application design and collaborative development through multiple team projects (Agile, XP, Scrum, Trello, Github, Live Share, Zoom).
- Developed the ability to quickly learn and use unfamiliar frameworks and technologies (JavaScript, Bootstrap, EJS, Cypress, Handlebars, TypeScript).

#### University of Greenwich

- BSc Computing (Hons) 2:1
